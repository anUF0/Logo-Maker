## Installation
Users will have to install the node.js as well as inquirer and is-css-color. The app should then run in an intergrated terminal.

## Usage
Upon starting the app the user will be given a series of promts. Answering each one will decied on the colour and shape of the background, along with a short text content that can also be coloured. Either hexadecimal values or css colour keys can be used to choose the desired colour. The created .svg file will then appear in the output folder.
